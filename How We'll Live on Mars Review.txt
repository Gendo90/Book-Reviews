"How We'll Live on Mars" is a great introductory book into the past, present, and future of humankind's progress towards exploring Mars. The author, Stephen Petranek, is a notable figure in mass-market science journalism, having served as editor-in-chief of Discover and a senior editor for science at Life. The book is relatively easy to read, considering the preponderance of technical science terms throughout the book, which are used to explain everything from how to get to Mars from Earth, the Martian climate and geography, how humans can build (eventually) self-sustaining settlements on Mars, and how the future of Mars may even involve terraforming the planet to be warmer with breathable atmosphere! The tone is optimistic, although some of the authors sentiments about NASA travelling to the Moon again and setting up a permanent base there and the politics involved with Mars exploration may be a little one-sided. For example, if the government HAD acted upon Wernher von Braun's Mars plans in Das Marsprojekt, we could potentially have faced decommissioning a Mars base build with obsolete technology from the 1980's or earlier, instead of decommissioning the ISS due to funding. Many of the ventures outlined in the book that planned Mars expeditions are now defunct, with NASA and SpaceX being the two main candidates with enough money and technical knowledge to seriously consider Mars missions. SpaceX is still planning on a manned mission to Mars in 2026, but that is highly dependent on their new Starship rocket working - which has had mixed success so far during its current testing program. This mission has been delayed multiple times in the past, so that 2026 target is tentative, and may still be pushed back further. Since NASA is not planning on a Mars mission until the 2030's, that seems like a good outer limit for the date of the first manned mission to Mars, but SpaceX still looks like it might be the first organization to send people to the Red Planet.
