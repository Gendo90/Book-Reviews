Author: Timothy Zahn
Description: Largely regarded as the best published Star Wars trilogy that has not yet graced the silver screen (and will likely never due to Disney now owning Star Wars and overwriting these books as 'canon'), the Thrawn Trilogy begins in Heir to the Empire and details the rise of a mysterious Imperial military outcast who can claim the remnants of the Empire and organize them against the fledgling New Republic. A New York Times bestseller.
