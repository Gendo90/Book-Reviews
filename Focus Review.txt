"Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence" was a book with a lot of surprises in store for me, because I approached it as a possible way to improve my focus at work to generally perform better, but it actually approaches the subject of "focus" from a neurological perspective and reads more like a compilation of science-based case studies than an actual focus training manual. There are some parts of the book that do provide tips for improving what we traditionally call focus, particularly studies and programs that use techniques like mindfulness, meditation, and active listening, and some studies address the cost/benefit of more controversial methods to train focus, like video games and card games, which appear to have the downsides of limiting normal social interaction and detracting from ordinary school/work responsibilities. Again, since the book relies heavily on scientific studies and the results of different programs to improve resiliency, reduce stress, and remove distractions, the brain regions and actual physiological changes and effects involved with these different aspects of "focus" are discussed in detail - which does not make for light reading! The main types of "focus" the author discusses are self focus (self-awareness), other focus (empathy and understanding those around you), and outer focus (understanding how you and others and your actions/work are part of a larger system), and posits that all three, in balance, are necessary for producing long-term, sustainable, and effective results as a leader, volunteer, employee, etc. The systems awareness part is particularly important, because it describes the long-term effects of our policies and actions, and how we as humans are not wired effectively to understand long-term effects as well as short-term results - using examples about how eating sugary, salty, or fatty food feels good at the moment but damages our health long term, and how fossil fuels and our excessive materialism are great for our economy short-term and terrible for the environment long-term. Systems understanding is a relatively new field and this book provides enough background when defining it as an important skill that must remain in focus during our decisions, both as individuals and as members of larger organizations. I personally think the book is worth buying just for the explanation of systems, which is a lot simpler and more relatable than you can find elsewhere, and the rest is good to know - although it might take some time because of the technical neurology language and dense writing style!
