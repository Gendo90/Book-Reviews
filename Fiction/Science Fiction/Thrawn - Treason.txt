A thrilling conclusion to the new Thrawn Trilogy, a rewrite of the original Star Wars canon to fit the new Disney Star Wars universe. This version gives more background to the titular character, and integrates well with other Star Wars canon (e.g. Star Wars Rebels), but I do miss the original books a little, since they featured more A-list Star Wars characters more prominently (Luke, Han, and Leia, I'm looking at you!), but this book did have some cameos from heavy-hitters like the Emperor and Tarkin. The strategy and tactics seem very polished, although keeping track of all the different schemes, environments, and reasoning behind every decision can make your head spin - it might be good to re-read after a first pass to get more out of the story. Overall, I am happy to have read it, but a little disappointd with the ending being so inconclusive - I almost expected another book to continue the story, but it looks like the trilogy ended according to Amazon, and I am not going to watch SW Rebels anytime soon to see what happens on Thrawn's next mission, so I had to look up spoilers online to see what happens. Other people might really like the integrated media franchise Disney is making, but I liked it when the books were self-contained - but it is nice there is more content coming out!
