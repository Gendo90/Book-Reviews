Forward the Foundation is the second book in the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov, and it certainly moves the plot forward much more than the previous book. There are some large jumps in time, to highlight certain periods of Hari Seldon's life when a notable event or chain of events occurs. The book is broken down into four of these highlights, with the first involving a conspiracy to overthrow the government, then the second concerning a resurgence of the conspiracy and resulting in a twist that does change the government, and the third concerning the new government's influence over psychohistory, and the fourth setting the groundwork for and outlining the next phases of the Foundations. At each stage, Hari loses someone close to him, and keeps working towards his interminable goal of developing psychohistory, until he himself is lost as well. All is not lost, however, as the two Foundations on separate planets gather strength to weather the fall of the Empire - his life's work.
