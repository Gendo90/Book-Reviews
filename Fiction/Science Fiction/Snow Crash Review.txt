Snow Crash is an exciting cyberpunk adventure into a world similar to our own, but perhaps more heavily influenced by capitalism, religion, and geopolitics - intertwining these themes throughout the novel to tell a gripping story revolving around a hero protagonist aptly named Hero Protagonist and a female skater lead who calls herself Y.T. Deemed one of the top 100 best English-language novels by Time magazine, this is a great choice of entertainment if you love science fiction, action, sociology, cyberpunk, computers, or any combination of these.
