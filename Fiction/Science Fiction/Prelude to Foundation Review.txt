Prelude to Foundation is the first prequel in the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov, and it starts the tale of Hari Seldon, his theory of psychohistory, and the foundation of the Foundation. Hari Seldon is a young mathematician in this prequel, delivers a paper about psychohistory at a convention on the capital world of Trantor, and is subsequently pursued by the Emperor and his minions and their rivals in order to make self-fulfilling prophecies for their benefit. The book is a little slow, with there only being a few major events with any action involved - most of the time, the book describes the different people and places of Trantor that the protagonists encounter, and has a lot of talking, politics, and scheming. Still, being the first book in the series, it makes sense to start slow and set up the setting and tone for the rest of the novels, which are hopefully a little more exciting.
