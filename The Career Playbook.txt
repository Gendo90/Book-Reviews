Author: James M. Citrin
Description: This book has a lot of good information about how to go about starting a career, and seems especially defensive of the liberal arts as a valid path to success in life. There are some good discussions about career phases and what is expected from a person during each phase, and mentions that most career trajectories are windy and not necessarily rockets up or stagnant. There was also a comparison about how much value/importance business leaders and younger employees think and feel about certain job attributes like financial reward, cultural fit, etc. from a study conducted by the author for this book. All in all, a solid read for an aspiring young professional!
