Description: This book is a great reference for basic and advanced cardio and strength-training exercises, designed to build strength and stamina especially for mixed-martial arts style competitions. As a result, a lot of the exercises are short in duration and change quickly throughout the workout plans, which mirrors the exertion pattern of the fighting rounds broken up by short time limits. These exercises are largely anaerobic, and some brisk walking or jogging is still needed to supplement the plan with aerobic exercise. Some of the basic workouts are geared towards improving energy, power, etc., and use workouts and drills similar to agility drills from sports training. Some of these exercises can cheaply be performed at home with simple, portable workout equipment, like kettlebells and medicine balls. Overall, a great book to have to plan and execute workouts that give you the results you want!
