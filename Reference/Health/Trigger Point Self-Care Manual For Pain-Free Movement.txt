Description: A good book for learning basic muscle groups and how to "release" them when they become overworked and rigid. Shows both locations on the muscles that can be pressed or massaged to relax the muscle, as well as stretches that can also help loosen up muscles. This book does not include that many face or head muscles, so I would recommend looking at the following website to learn about fixing those muscles: http://www.triggerpoints.net/
