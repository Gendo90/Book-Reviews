This was a refreshing look at time management and the modern trend to try to optimize our productivity and use our time 
as efficiently as possible, which gives a top-down view of time and how it is "used," and perceived by humans. It takes the stance that we have approximately 4000 weeks to live, and can spend those weeks doing activities or having goals that are meaningful to us as individuals, while knowing that there will never be enough time to complete or even start everything we would like to do in our lives. The author, Oliver Burkeman, explains that we can become more effective at completing some of our life goals, but even as we become more efficient and get more done, we simply add proportionally more and more items we want to address to our bucket lists. As a result, we should only try to accomplish our most salient goals in life, knowing that by completing these primary objectives, other important goals may be neglected - which makes the ones we chose to pursue all that more important, given the opportunity cost of everything else we could do or have done.
