Description: Jim Kwik introduces readers to some learning strategies that can improve their cognitive skills including memory, thinking, and studying, as well as tackle topics related to learning that have a large impact on an individual's progress and performance - namely motivation and mindset. The book has a lot of good information about how to learn and prep yourself for learning new material, but a few topics may not be relevant or useful for everyone. For example, Kwik advocates speed reading to reduce study time, but this might have the drawback of costing more energy, and even if he will not admit it, reducing reading comprehension or at least a deeper understanding of the material that comes from taking the time to think through the words on the page, not just reading them.
