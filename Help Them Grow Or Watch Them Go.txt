Description: A solid guide to career management, mostly from a manager’s viewpoint with respect to his employees, but also self-applicable. This book looks at how there are many ways to grow in a modern career position, which do not necessarily involve promotion. Some of the main points of the text are that employee growth should be happening constantly, with workplace culture allowing and facilitating this growth, and that organizations that support constant growth have advantages in retention, service, motivation, etc. over those that do not as actively or consistently watch and assist employee growth. It is a hugely popular book, so it might be good to read to just put yourself in your supervisor’s shoes once in a while and look at yourself from their perspective!
