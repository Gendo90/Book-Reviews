Author: Dale Carnegie
Description: This book contains a list of social or interpersonal guidelines that can be used to "win friends and influence people" - with each chapter illustrating the impact of each item on the list with anecdotes from personal development workshops featuring this material. The book itself was created after 15 years of iterative development of these principles in Dale Carnegie's personal development workshops, and was initially designed to be a training manual for teaching adults to "get along with and understand people" - the second most sought-after topic in adult education behind health!
