Author: Charlie Houpert
Description: A good book to read if interested in trying to become more personable and/or possibly influence other people more. Some of the advice seems really solid, like never complaining or letting people know that you are tired/uncomfortable/bored, but a lot of the book is subjective and based on the author's own life, which might not be imitable in yours - like asking for major raises soon after being hired. It is fun to see people following his advice in daily life, like talking loudly, using expansive gestures, and smiling A LOT. There is a "Charisma Workout" plan at the end of the book, which gives you activities and a timeline to upgrade your charisma. Again, even if you do not subscribe to the author's methods or follow his "workout" plan, you might be able to see people around you following this advice, so it might be good to read just to know what is going on!
