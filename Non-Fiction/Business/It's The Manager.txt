Description: "It's The Manager" is a clear, concise book written to promote Gallup's strengths-based leadership and development program. It uses data gathered by Gallup, arguably the leading data collection and analysis agency in the world, to support the thesis that business performance is highly correlated with employee engagement, and that employee engagement is a direct result from good management. Thus, each manager should endeavor to keep their teams and employees as engaged as possible to improve business performance. A lot of the book delves into how a manager can act to promote engagement and what an employee desires to become or remain engaged. For example, younger employees want their manager to act as a coach more than a boss or supervisor, which might involve more guidance or training than the role previously encompassed.
