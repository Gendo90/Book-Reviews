Description: While this may take you longer than 10 days to read and really get everything understood, it does a great job introducing and explaining a lot of core business principles and skills that are universally applicable to understanding or developing a business. Useful to read even if you only learn how to read business financial statements (e.g. balance sheets, income statements, and cashflows) for investing purposes and assess opportunity costs/mind maps/Monte Carlo probability simulations for general knowledge and everyday usage.
