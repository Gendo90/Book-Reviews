Description: A clear and concise guide to finding, purchasing, and renting real estate. This is not a get-rich-quick guide, and the authors do their best to give a realistic representation of the benefits and disadvantages of buying, holding, and operating real estate from both legal and financial perspectives. Also good for learning how to purchase a home, since it goes through the real estate transaction process, and even claims that many homeowners turn their first home into a rental property after they outgrow it or decide to move!
