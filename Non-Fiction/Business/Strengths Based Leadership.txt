Description: People often spend their self-improvement energy to mitigate weaknesses, while this book questions that philosophy and asks - why not build on their strengths instead? In the real world, employees get hired based on their core skills and/or areas of strength, which then continue to improve, so why not do the same with leadership and personal qualities? Includes an assessment revealing your top 5 strengths!
