The Cuckoo's Egg is a true story about tracking a cybercriminal through the world wide web and uncovering a gang of young hackers on drugs. The protagonist (and author) is Cliff Stoll, a postgraduate researcher/computer administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley Labs at UC Berkeley, who discovered a 75 cent accounting error in mainframe usage times that led down a rabbithole across the country and eventually outside the continent, through universities, government contractors, military bases, and even federal agencies (including NASA). Most of the story revolves around Cliff Stoll doggedly tracing the hacker and recording his intrusions, while also trying to raise awareness and get support from the government. In fact, it was surprisingly hard to get the government to do anything at all about this hacker - they had reports of other hackers, but Cliff Stoll's persistence and detailed records helped make this a landmark case and turning point for cybersecurity as a whole. It was also interesting to note that the information mainly traveled in one direction - from Cliff Stoll to the government, but not back, which seemed like an uncomfortable difference in philosophy for someone in academia like Cliff Stoll. Social engineering played a key role in tracing and catching the hacker towards the end of the book, and leaves one with a better understanding of how the hacker and a cybersecurity expert are not so different after all - maybe only by the color of their hats!
