Description: A quick look into the psychology behind many of the Game of Thrones characters and themes, especially addressing the relative brutality of the series. I personally have not read the Game of Thrones series or watched the show, so it also provides a good introduction to some main characters and plotlines. My personal favorite was the "Need and Greed" section, about drives to consume or attain more of a resource than necessary!
