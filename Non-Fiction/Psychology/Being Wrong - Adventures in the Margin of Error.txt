Description: This book is a great way to learn about error and human mistakes - since they are common to all of us, and there are not many resources for learning about, defining, or understanding errors and how and why we make mistakes. The book explains how we can view error differently, as a way to learn and improve, as an integral part of human, and as inescapable, countering the basic, general self-belief that we are correct about something and that certainty is desirable. The importance of error, its different forms, and its usefulness in different fields is examined in this book, and although you may not completely agree with the author that error can be desirable in certain situations, taking away the universality of mistakes and errors and that being wrong about anything is common and understandable is important. Even if you do not want to make more mistakes, you can at least understand mistakes you see other people make and why they might make them, as a basic study of human nature.
