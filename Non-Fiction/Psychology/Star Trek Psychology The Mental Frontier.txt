Description: An intriguing collection of essays delving into psychology topics and phenomena observable in the various Star Trek series and movies. This book has a more positive bent than the other psychology books in the series, especially compared to the Game of Thrones book. I personally learned a lot about group dynamics and how creativity works from those particular chapters. This book has some good insight into topics relevant to most people's lives, like friendship and parenting, so enjoy it and live long and prosper!
