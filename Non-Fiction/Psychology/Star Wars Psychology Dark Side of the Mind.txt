Description: A collection of graduate level essays on the topic of Star Wars and its psychological underpinnings. The book cover a broad range of issues that come to light over the course of the saga. My personal favorite involved dissecting the story using Jungian archetypes, since it explained the characters on a more basic, universal level.
