Description: This book has been a great guide for learning all kinds of common body language! Some of the information may not be 100% correct all the time, and I wish they explained that more in the book - for example, the book claims that people scratch their necks 5 times and rarely more or fewer when they are uncertain, but I doubt that is true - I personally almost never scratch my neck more than three times. However, the book overall is great, and covers more than just gestures and faces - it also includes entire chapters on personal space and handshakes. The book is an international bestseller for a reason, and I highly recommend it!
