Description: This book is a great tool for learning the Python language in a straightforward, logical way. The text goes into detail about best practices and common design patterns, explaining the language in clear sentences punctuated by code examples, tips, and tables. Much preferable to the online documentation, which may be more thorough but is essentially formatted as dictionary entries for functions and packages instead of explaining common usage of the language in depth. Also great as a reference tool for looking up data structures, built-in functions and methods, and quick and easy explanations of new code features that you may not have implemented before.
