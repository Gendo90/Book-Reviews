Author: Frank Herbert
Description: A seminal work in the science fiction genre, no collection is complete without Dune. An environmentally-conscious epic set in the far future, feuding noble families play politics, with direct conflict almost assured when the Emperor forces House Atreides to move from their homeworld of Caladan to Arrakis, the font of the medicinal "spice" resource and the cornerstone of their rival House Harkonnen's wealth.
