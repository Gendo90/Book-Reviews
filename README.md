# Best Book Collection Reviews

## Introduction
This repo contains the text from my book review website, available [here](https://www.bestbookcollection.com/), which was created as a capstone project for the "Fullstack Web Developer" Udacity Nanodegree in late 2018.

The website uses OAuth2.0 to use Facebook or Google accounts to login to the app, but in the past year or so (~2021) the Google API that was being used for OAuth2.0 was deprecated, and I have not had time to migrate to the new API due to work and other projects. The login is essential for adding, editing, or deleting book reviews, so books can no longer be added to the website with a Google account.

As a result, the review text and book authors from the website are now available as text files in this repo - any new reviews will be added here instead of my website.

The website simulated a "tree" of categories with the books and their corresponding reviews constituting the "leaves," so that same data structure will be used here to organize the books and reviews into categorical folders and subfolders.
